The NLSA COLLABORATIVE is a solidarity project. We are:

-people who stutter (PWS)
-members of provincial government
-public-school teachers
-speech-language pathologists (SLP)
-academics
-university students
-mental health professionals
-disability advocates
-NLSA members.

We are all brought together around a common goal to address the current needs of people who stutter in Newfoundland and Labrador.

We are guided by the following goals:

1. For People Who Stutter

-To determine how many PWS live in NL. We currently do not know this basic fact about our province.
-To understand what services are available for Preschoolers (1-5yrs.), school age (6-13yrs), adolescents and adults (14-85 plus) who stutter, and identify any gaps in this system.
-To gauge awareness of resources available to PWS.

2. For Service Providers

-To assess needs and access to resources for SLPs, Early Childhood Educators (ECEs), Teachers, Guidance Counsellors, Health Clinicians, etc.

3. For Our Communities

-To ask community members about their perceptions of stuttering and what role they may play in removing barriers for PWS.
